# WorkmanWise — Ideology & Brand

---

## Core Belief (never stated verbatim on the site)

> **Manufacturing isn't broken — it's fragmented.**
> **AI's job is to glue it back together.**

We are not selling tools. We are selling **flow**.

---

## The Translation Problem (Why This Matters)

The project's original sin would be speaking in "operator mode" too early. Visitors feel the pain but don't label it technically. A salesperson doesn't think "post processor" — they think "why does the floor keep asking me questions I already answered?"

### The Fix: Layering, Not Dilution

We don't remove technical language. We **delay it**.

Every concept exists in **two registers**:

| Plain-language layer | Technical layer |
|---------------------|----------------|
| "We remove handoff friction" | "We standardize CAD → CAM → Post → Machine flow" |
| "Your best decisions stop getting lost" | "Decision memory persists across tools" |
| "Less tribal knowledge" | "Codified, repeatable workflows" |
| "Instructions your machines actually follow" | "Post processors" |
| "How decisions get reused (or don't)" | "CAM strategies" |

### UX Rule (enforced everywhere):
- **Headline** = plain
- **Subtext** = technical
- **Expand-on-click** = deep technical

This keeps the site legible to non-machinists and credible to experts.

## Reframing AI (Critical)

Non-technical users don't care *how*. They care: Does it remember? Does it adapt? Does it remove rework?

| Instead of | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| "AI-powered" | "Decision-carrying" |
| "AI-first" | "Experience-aware" |
| "Models" | "Systems" |
| "AI magic" | Never. |

AI stays **implied**, not foregrounded.

The phrase "AI-first doesn't mean AI in charge" still works — but only in the deeper explanation section, not the hero.

## Identity

WorkmanWise is a **collective of machinists and designers** who got tired of friction.

We use AI the same way we use fixtures and probes: carefully, deliberately, and for the job it's meant to do.

We are not a software startup. We are practitioners who build tools for practitioners.

## Who We Serve

### The Newcomer
- Has a design but has never bought a machine
- Needs guidance, not just software
- **Sees:** "Things break at handoffs" → immediately understands

### The Growing Shop
- Has machines, has experience, has gaps
- Doing things manually that shouldn't need to be manual
- **Sees:** "We keep decisions moving" → knows exactly what that means

### The Established Operation
- Complex workflows, experienced team
- Needs a partner who speaks the language
- **Sees:** Technical depth on expand-click → respects the precision

### The Salesperson / Entrepreneur
- Exposed to manufacturing but not deeply technical
- Cares about: Can I promise this? Will it get done right?
- **Sees:** "Promise Protection" and "Process Clarity" → directly addresses their anxiety

---

## Tone of Voice

- **Confident, not arrogant** — we know our stuff, but we don't lecture
- **Practical** — no buzzwords. Say what it does.
- **Declarative** — short sentences. No paragraphs where a line will do.
- **Layered** — plain first, technical beneath, deep on demand
- **Calm** — no urgency, no hype, no countdown timers

### What We Never Do
- Say "AI magic" or "revolutionary"
- Use cartoon robots or stock photos of people smiling at laptops
- Use startup cringe language ("disrupt", "10x", "unlock")
- Create artificial urgency
- Lead with technical jargon above the fold
- Assume the visitor knows where pain originates

## Core Messages

### Universal (non-technical, above the fold)
> "Most manufacturing problems aren't machine problems. They're handoff problems."

### Primary Brand
> "We keep decisions moving forward without friction."

### Variations
> "Your machines aren't the problem. The gaps between tools are."

> "We don't replace machinists. We remove the friction between their tools."

> "Modern manufacturing runs on experience — we just keep it moving."

---

## Brand Personality

Think:
- CNC control panel
- Old shop wisdom
- Modern clarity
- Conveyor belts, not dashboards
- Flow visuals, not CNC visuals everywhere

Not:
- Hype gradients
- "AI magic" language
- Startup demo energy
- Too many acronyms above the fold

---

## Ad Philosophy (When the Time Comes)

Early traction comes from forums, referrals, word of mouth, credibility. No ads at launch.

When ads run, they look like **manifestos**, not pitches:

> "AI shouldn't replace machinists. It should remove the glue work."

> "Your machines aren't the problem. The gaps between tools are."

> "Most manufacturing problems aren't machine problems. They're handoff problems."

Statements, not sales.
