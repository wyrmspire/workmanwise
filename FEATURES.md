# WorkmanWise — Products, Services & Expansion

---

## Framing

We don't call them "products" or "features" on the site.
We call them **focused tools for real work.**

Everything lives under one umbrella concept:

### Flow Intelligence
Not a product name on screen. A **promise**:

> "Flow Intelligence ensures decisions move forward without friction."

Everything else is organized into **product families** beneath this.

---

## Product Families

### Family 1: Decision Capture & Memory
*Tools that turn conversations into workflow intelligence.*

| Product | Plain explanation | Trigger | Output | For |
|---------|-----------------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Decision Memory** | "Your best decisions stop getting lost between steps" | Decision made in workflow | Stored, retrievable decision context | All roles |
| **Setup Recall** | "Start where you left off, not from scratch" | New job with similar parameters | Pre-loaded setup from history | Machinists |
| **Constraint Library** | "What this machine can and can't do — always current" | Machine configuration change | Updated constraint set | CAM / Ops |

---

### Family 2: Meeting-to-Action Automation
*One-shot tools that act immediately after meetings.*

| Product | Plain explanation | Trigger | Output | For |
|---------|-----------------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Meeting Capture** | "Decisions from the meeting become tasks on the floor" | Post-meeting summary | Action items mapped to workflow steps | All roles |
| **Commitment Tracker** | "What was promised, to whom, by when" | Promise made in conversation | Tracked commitment with status | Sales / Ops |

---

### Family 3: Workflow Monitoring & Guardrails
*Quiet software that watches processes and flags drift.*

| **Flow Health** | "Is this workflow still healthy?" | Periodic check | Simple health score + recommendations | Ops / Founders |

---

### Family 4: Promise Protection (Sales & Ops)
*Tools that prevent overpromising and misalignment.*

| Product | Plain explanation | Trigger | Output | For |
|---------|-----------------|---------|--------|-----|
| **Process Clarity** | "Know what's possible before you promise it" | Quote or commitment being drafted | Feasibility check against constraints | Sales |

---

### Family 5: Knowledge → System Conversion
*Turning experience into repeatable behavior.*

---

### Family 8: Strategic Services (Non-Software)
*Human-in-the-loop. Audits, reviews, consulting.*

| Service | Plain explanation | Trigger | Output | For |
|---------|-----------------|---------|--------|-----|

| **Process Design** | "We design how work should flow" | New line / new product | Documented workflow blueprint | Founders / Ops |
| **Integration Review** | "Do your tools actually talk to each other?" | System evaluation | Gap analysis + roadmap | Ops / IT |

---

### Family 9: Streamline Essentials (Lean/JIT-Inspired)
*Tools that mold operations into streamlined flows — without overhauls.*

Subtly inspired by lean manufacturing and Just-In-Time principles. No buzzwords upfront — lean/JIT references surface only in expand-on-click depth.

## The Expansion Prompt

The following prompt can be used to generate additional products and services on demand. It's designed to produce ideas that are already organized, non-technical, and UI-ready.

```
You are a product strategist designing offerings for a manufacturing-focused
AI company whose core mission is:

"Keep decisions moving forward without friction."

The audience includes:
- Machinists
- Salespeople
- Founders
- Operations managers
- Entrepreneurs exposed to manufacturing but not deeply technical

Your task is to generate a LARGE, ORGANIZED CATALOG of products and services.

---

### CORE CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT BREAK)

1. Products must be explainable in ONE SENTENCE to a non-technical person.
2. Avoid technical jargon in names.
3. Favor "one-shot automation" over complex dashboards.
4. Favor background monitoring over active usage.
5. Many ideas should be triggered by:
   - Meetings
   - Conversations
   - Decisions being made verbally
6. Products should feel like:
   - Assistants
   - Guards
   - Memory
   - Glue between steps
7. Assume UX favors:
   - Small cards
   - Expand-on-click details
   - Image placeholders
   - Minimal copy per surface
8. AI is implied — never foregrounded.

---

### ORGANIZATION REQUIREMENT

Group ideas into clear PRODUCT FAMILIES.
Each family should feel like a category on a website.

For EACH PRODUCT FAMILY, provide:
- Family name (plain, confident, non-technical)
- One-sentence purpose
- 5–10 individual products or services inside it

For EACH PRODUCT / SERVICE, provide:
1. Name (short, human, no jargon)
2. One-sentence explanation (plain language)
3. Trigger (what causes it to run)
4. Output (what the user gets)
5. Who it's for (role-based)
6. UI representation (card, badge, alert, timeline, report, etc.)

---

### REQUIRED PRODUCT FAMILIES TO INCLUDE

You MUST include (but are not limited to):

1. Decision Capture & Memory
2. Meeting-to-Action Automation
3. Workflow Monitoring & Guardrails
4. Promise Protection (Sales & Ops)
5. Knowledge → System Conversion
6. Process Health & Visibility
7. Lightweight Automation
8. Strategic Services (Non-Software)

---

### UX / PRESENTATION LAYER

After generating the catalog, ALSO PROVIDE:

1. A proposed WEBSITE NAV STRUCTURE that can hold 50+ ideas without clutter
2. A CARD-BASED UI SYSTEM that allows:
   - Scanning
   - Grouping
   - Progressive disclosure
3. Suggestions for IMAGE PLACEHOLDERS that visually explain ideas without text
4. A way to show "this runs in the background" vs "you actively use this"

---

### FINAL STEP

End with:
- How this catalog avoids overwhelm
- Why this system feels simple despite its power
- How a non-technical visitor understands the value in under 30 seconds

---

IMPORTANT:
Do not optimize for cleverness.
Optimize for clarity, calm, inevitability, and trust.
```

---

## UI System for 50+ Products

### Card-Based Display

Each product is a **card**. Cards live in **family grids**.

**Card anatomy:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ [icon/placeholder]          │
│                             │
│ Product Name                │
│ One-sentence explanation    │
│                             │
│ [badge: background/active]  │
│ [badge: role]               │
│                             │
│ [expand: "How this works"]  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Expanded card shows:**
- Technical explanation
- Trigger + output details
- Integration points
- Screenshot/mockup placeholder

### Visual Distinction: Background vs Active

| Type | Badge | Icon style | Card behavior |
|------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Runs in background | "Always watching" | Subtle pulse dot | Muted card, quiet presence |
| You use directly | "Hands-on" | Solid icon | Standard card, clear CTA |
| Service (human) | "With our team" | People icon | Slightly different card style |

## Open Questions

- Which products are real today vs planned vs conceptual?
- Which is the single "free gateway" tool?
- Backend/API status for any of these?
- Payment processing — Stripe?
- User accounts — same site or separate app?
